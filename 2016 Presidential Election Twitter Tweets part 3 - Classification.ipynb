Imagine the world in which cat pictures are the stupidest thing. Can one get transferred into that world? @nehanarkhede @jessfraz Wondered whether you'd mention in your keynote. LOLed when you did. Also related, youth sports is full of coaches like @erinscafe who give so much time and care to kids. The bad ones shouldn't be tolerated. @nehanarkhede Im hoping that wasnt as cringeworthy at I fear it was. Looking forward to your keynote. Just listened to @solrac901  discuss @ApacheSpot. Thinking of possible new applications for ML at @MailChimp. #ATO2016 @adickerson  @ComfortablySmug I could not be more intrigued than by a topic recommended by both Drudge and @jdickerson. @skamille cats don't care. Just look at the expression. @Michael_Tsunam1 @samnesmith Important clarification.

       "1737    Listening to @nehanarkhede talk about event streams at #ATO2016 and thinking about how to continue evolving our Kafka-based pipeline. Related, man would I love to have @erinscafe as a coach for my kids. If youre interested in processing streaming data at scale, @MailChimp is hiring: https://t.co/MYxL4mCkaC Come see us if youre at #ATO2016. @rachaelmaddux Just when I think I couldnt love her more. If you coach or have kids in youth sports, this is well worth reading. https://t.co/BEdjKmZ28H @_raven_io @pwnela Im well past the three month mark and still not sure Im setwhich is cool, but could be distressing if unexpected. Moving on to discussion of IoT, ML, and AR by @GregU. (Lots of buzzwords there.) Just learning of @PTC's acquisition of @Vuforia. #ATO2016 Wish @nehanarkhede had asked how many were actively using Kafka. I suspect it would have still been sizable. https://t.co/OVy8zXHeiT @erinscafe @salrelish I'm pretty reserved, but if this happened to a team I coached or had kid onI don't know how I'd handle it. Appalling. @KyFaSt Congrats! Super happy for you and happy to get to work with you as any sort of engineeror just plain person. Starting day at #ATO2016. Looking forward to keynotesparticularly @nehanarkhede and talks through the day. Come see us at @MailChimp booth @SwiftOnSecurity @dcloues Wow. Imagine the world in which cat pictures are the stupidest thing. Can one get transferred into that world? @nehanarkhede @jessfraz Wondered whether you'd mention in your keynote. LOLed when you did. Also related, youth sports is full of coaches like @erinscafe who give so much time and care to kids. The bad ones shouldn't be tolerated. @nehanarkhede Im hoping that wasnt as cringeworthy at I fear it was. Looking forward to your keynote. Just listened to @solrac901  discuss @ApacheSpot. Thinking of possible new applications for ML at @MailChimp. #ATO2016 @adickerson  @ComfortablySmug I could not be more intrigued than by a topic recommended by both Drudge and @jdickerson. @skamille cats don't care. Just look at the expression. @Michael_Tsunam1 @samnesmith Important clarification. I was concerned for a bit there. @bakins Im so sorry. @JessicaMauerhan If youre still around and interested, I held some swag for you at the booth. Were to the right as you enter building.

What will you do about it? https://t.co/V5lJ1hWcCf #shootatweet Please try to remember that Julian Assange is fighting extradition for RAPE charges. Hes not a patriot. Hes a selfish entitled asshole. Hey, thanks for spoiling that new Walking Dead episode, everybody. @Real_TJ_Thomas @gruber Well, yeah. I think we all agree there. Guess what, dudes? You were BORN privileged. As the great Ann Richards once said, you were born on third base, thinking you hit a triple. EVEN IF all the failures Trump accuses Hillary of ARE true (theyre not) theyd still be just a small fraction of his ACTUAL failures. This email bullshit is why LBJ had all his conversations on the shitter. @SenatorBoxer, another one killed by guns in Sacramento today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/5NLbMxJmnn #shootatweet @parisvega @espiekermann No. You cant even compare the two. @MikeHosier Yeah, the luxury watch did great. And NO. @ChappellTracker Were talking about Frozen, right? @drwave @beaucolburn Id throw in #choad too. @halvorson Is that Gilmore Girls? Do not argue with eggs. @NancyPelosi, 2 people were injured by guns in Los Angeles today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/EBk9OEqBp4 #shootatweet I honestly cant take two more weeks of this shit. Is anyone here a brand manager? https://t.co/IFqJc90E5h @designhawg One would think. @SenFeinstein, another one killed by guns in Los Angeles today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/NbtGsxMYLq #shootatweet So what? Its illegal for one.  https://t.co/gszEoiwAIt I thought about it. Youre an idiot. https://t.co/iN1WPXqga6 Agreed. https://t.co/VIMRejMlzG @SenatorBoxer, 2 people were injured by guns in Los Angeles today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/EBk9OEqBp4 #shootatweet Whats wrong with the Comp Kickstarter? It doesnt pass the Warhol Coke test. We dont need luxury versions of comm https://t.co/S81O3jTO6u You can buy this rifle RIGHT NOW on @facebook. https://t.co/J7lN7Fde0a and when youre running a gun marketplace, as @facebook is, you can target your gun sales to whites only. https://t.co/ihUwWZBZAZ Everything. https://t.co/OT7X69Aira Theres no happier sight in sports than Tony Romo holding a clipboard. @SenatorBoxer, another one killed by guns in Lincoln today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/6hM1dG0BHF #shootatweet Were CITIZENS, asshole. CITIZENS. https://t.co/t6gFZgNoKF Its sooooo true. https://t.co/7PgG6E0q1C @sjarvis Thank YOU. The @GOP promises to go out guns blazing. Because theyre not responsible for enough gun deaths across America. https://t.co/sN3foOCTel @united Please learn how to run an airline. Hi. We are in the middle of a coup. This is how it happens. @NancyPelosi, another one killed by guns in Lincoln today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/6hM1dG0BHF #shootatweet @zeldman Still not a fan. These things say more about designers ineptitude than client issues. @natts @astronautpnguin Ok, Dave. Correct me. Was I wrong? I will apologize if I was. Oh shit! I need a ride to the burn unit! https://t.co/zmBd7C5w31 Remember that thing about @facebook allowing advertisers to target by race? Someone used it! https://t.co/QnIPzgYPxL @matt_timmons @austinkleon I AM kidding. I was going to watch it later, but after what Im hearing nope. When you refer to job cuts as a percentage you are dehumanizing people. This is 350 PEOPLE. It matters. https://t.co/2yzzE8DtFj @gruber We should reinstate Pete Rose and ban YOU from baseball. Just the worst fan. And when you fire 350 people and your investors cheer you need to wonder about what kind of people youre in bed with. Fuck Wall St. This election has revealed that men can stumble dick-first into success while women have to walk a tightrope to just have a chance. That Composition book kickstarter reminds me of the time a restaurant tried to sell me a $20 pretzel. Fuck your $20 pretzel. Cheap is best. Hey @facebook! Half these posts LITERALLY have guns for sale in the title. Thats hard to flag how?!? https://t.co/vE01yJXLgO Designers need to focus on fixing problems for those who need help, not creating luxury versions of things that work just fine. @de5igner @madebyfew Yeah, Im not crazy about this. And a little concerned that the conference retweeted it. Trust me, Im capable of being angry about two things. Three if you wanna press it. https://t.co/lPhfz5LQtB Love it. https://t.co/ppT3EELz5Q @gruber Sigh. You did. Pretty great. The last few days have the tinge of a coup on them. Like democracy is being pulled out from under us. Fair enough. Ill go do that. And hey! You go fuck yourself! https://t.co/8POhLNmYlq Check out #gunsonfacebookrightnow and see how seriously @facebook is taking its gun ban. They could pull these tonight if they wanted to. My friend @romanmars makes good radio. Join me in supporting Radiotopia 2016. https://t.co/Ri5XJjFDbY Looks like I've had my last Yuengling. https://t.co/L40YuaGEeo @SenatorBoxer, another one killed by guns in Los Angeles today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/V5lJ1hWcCf #shootatweet You can buy this RIGHT NOW on @facebook. https://t.co/KO7k3vFBO9 LOL. I havent  even made the joke about how much designers love making things with lay-flat spines. Way to project. Says the man who felt the need to jump on Twitter to continue berating a woman. https://t.co/bxTn2fwstF @mat Well, actually Mat. In fairness, were not racist, but all lives matter. Hey fools! Go see this movie! my friend @sonia__harris designed a bunch of stuff for it. She's all talented and shi https://t.co/B5YcOJN94T Designers, I only pick on you because I love you and I know youre capable of so much more. But somewhere along the line you forgot. and right now, people need you like they havent needed you in a long time. Help me with a thing. Go to @facebook. Find a gun for sale. Post a screenshot here with #gunsonfacebookrightnow. White men realize they dont HAVE to come to the defense of tech corporations, right? @SenFeinstein, 2 people were injured by guns in Los Angeles today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/EBk9OEqBp4 #shootatweet @SherylCababa @austinkleon Yes, but when the disenfranchised pull out sharpies at a restaurant and mark the plates they get arrested. @dansinker No. meet me in Berlin next week. Well start a whole government in exile thing. @SenFeinstein, another one killed by guns in Sacramento today. What will you do about it? https://t.co/5NLbMxJmnn #shootatweet Maybe stop building things for Wall St and go back to making things people need. An update on taking down @facebooks guns from @jbsibley: https://t.co/aBQiTYDxC7 I block gun nuts, racists, alt-right pricks, and mens group turds. Subscribe to my @blocktogether and benefit : https://t.co/sRLiJetnnd @gruber Only YOU would root for Cleveland over Americas sweethearts. @ToddRoss Yeah, it was visceral enough in the comic. And I hear its worse on film. I don't really feel a need to experience that. All those times you were interrupted? Told to smile more? Passed over for a job? In 10 days you can elect Americas first woman president. Some of you may not realize that the 2016 Mansplaining Olympics started this morning.  https://t.co/IJWyUclVQl Blatant lie. They harass and suspend us for reporting illegal gun sales. https://t.co/KVR5dSvR88 Cubs be cubbin. Thanks to everyone at #MxF2016 for being an amazing audience today.  \n",

       "0  Listening to @nehanarkhede talk about event streams at #ATO2016 and thinking about how to continue evolving our Kafka-based pipeline. Related, man would I love to have @erinscafe as a coach for my kids. If youre interested in processing streaming data at scale, @MailChimp is hiring: https://t.co/MYxL4mCkaC Come see us if youre at #ATO2016. @rachaelmaddux Just when I think I couldnt love her more. If you coach or have kids in youth sports, this is well worth reading. https://t.co/BEdjKmZ28H @_raven_io @pwnela Im well past the three month mark and still not sure Im setwhich is cool, but could be distressing if unexpected. Moving on to discussion of IoT, ML, and AR by @GregU. (Lots of buzzwords there.) Just learning of @PTC's acquisition of @Vuforia. #ATO2016 Wish @nehanarkhede had asked how many were actively using Kafka. I suspect it would have still been sizable. https://t.co/OVy8zXHeiT @erinscafe @salrelish I'm pretty reserved, but if this happened to a team I coached or had kid onI don't know how I'd handle it. Appalling. @KyFaSt Congrats! Super happy for you and happy to get to work with you as any sort of engineeror just plain person. Starting day at #ATO2016. Looking forward to keynotesparticularly @nehanarkhede and talks through the day. Come see us at @MailChimp booth @SwiftOnSecurity @dcloues Wow. Imagine the world in which cat pictures are the stupidest thing. Can one get transferred into that world? @nehanarkhede @jessfraz Wondered whether you'd mention in your keynote. LOLed when you did. Also related, youth sports is full of coaches like @erinscafe who give so much time and care to kids. The bad ones shouldn't be tolerated. @nehanarkhede Im hoping that wasnt as cringeworthy at I fear it was. Looking forward to your keynote. Just listened to @solrac901  discuss @ApacheSpot. Thinking of possible new applications for ML at @MailChimp. #ATO2016 @adickerson  @ComfortablySmug I could not be more intrigued than by a topic recommended by both Drudge and @jdickerson. @skamille cats don't care. Just look at the expression. @Michael_Tsunam1 @samnesmith Important clarification. I was concerned for a bit there. @bakins Im so sorry. @JessicaMauerhan If youre still around and interested, I held some swag for you at the booth. Were to the right as you enter building.
